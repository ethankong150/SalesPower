## SalesPower Overview:

SalesPower is a tool to better connect customers with the retail stores they buy from and the brands that supply the products!

Currently, there are issues for customers to find the best deals for products they want to buy. Often times, different retail stores and the brand themselves will price the same product differently, whether that is due to a coupon or not. SalesPower aims to create a simpler universal coupon system that allows users a simple comparison interface between the various vendors and brands, allowing for customers to get the best deals!


### SalesPower Application details:

The application is split into seven pages. The first page serves as a landing page to send the user to the correct login portal. So if the user is a 'Customer', they'll be sent to the customer login page. And if the user is a brand employee, they'll be sent to the brand employee login page. 

#### Login Pages:
Having the types of users be sent to different login pages allows the various login pages to have differing GET requests to authenticate the users login information as the customer, retial meployee, and brand employee login information is all stored in separate tables. 

#### Customer Page:
After the customer's login informatino is confirmed, they are sent to the customer page, where they'll be to able to see a table of active coupons and the terms/details of each coupon. We used another GET request to view all of the coupons currently in the database.
